# Model Data Protection
This project uses RP to protect training data of ML model.
- **ModelTraining.ipynb** file is used to train and test an ML model by DAC data.
- **ModelTrainingRP.ipynb** file is used to train and test an ML model by random projected (DAC) data. Both training and test data projected by same random matrix.
- **ModelInvalidRP.ipynb** file is used to train an ML model by random projected (DAC) data. Training and test data projected by different random matrices.
